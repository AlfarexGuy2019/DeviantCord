# DeviantCord
This repository will soon contain the source code for the Discord Bot DeviantCord. As of this time the team is still trying to cleanup code and implement needed features to ensure that the bot meets our quality standards for an open beta release.

# FAQ
#### What is DeviantCord?
DeviantCord is a Discord Bot with the primary function of integrating into DeviantArt. Its biggest feature right now is being able to automatically check certain DA Gallery folders and post a notification in Discord when a new deviation is posted. 

#### What Programming language does the bot use?
DeviantCord currently is developed with Python 3.6, versions below are not supported as of right now. This may change as we want to give flexiability. 

#### How can we check your progress on the bot?
Until the open beta release, the Github page is the best place to find what we are currently working on in the Tasks Section

#### How long until the public beta?
It shouldn't be longer then a weeks, but no promises. Updates will be posted here

# Tasks
These should not take long to implement
