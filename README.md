# DeviantCord
DeviantCord is a Discord bot that will allow artists and fan communities to keep up to date on their favorite artists on DeviantArt through Discord. 

For example posting links to your comic each time you post a new page is something this bot will replace. It will automatically check the configured artists folders for new entries and will post a new message in a specific Discord channel when a new deviation is found with a link to the deviation. 

DeviantCord can be self hosted, or you can use our free service to host the bot for you. 

# FAQ
#### What is DeviantCord?
DeviantCord is a Discord Bot with the primary function of integrating into DeviantArt. Its biggest feature right now is being able to automatically check certain DA Gallery folders and post a notification in Discord when a new deviation is posted. 

#### What Programming language does the bot use?
DeviantCord currently is developed with Python 3.6, versions below are not supported as of right now. This may change as we want to give flexiability.
