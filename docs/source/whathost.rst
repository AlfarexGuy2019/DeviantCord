Should I Self Host?
**********************

If you do not have some experience with SSH in Linux and want to put this in a production server
that is public it is recommended that you request hosting through us. We run reliable servers with
experts configuring and maintaining the servers.

Self Hosting should really be reserved if you want to control all aspects of the bot and handle the technical details
as well.

If you are still unsure or have any questions you can ask on our Discord server!
