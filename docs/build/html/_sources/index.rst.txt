   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to DeviantCord's documentation!
=======================================

.. warning::
    This documentation is still being worked on, while it is largely done here.
    Some things are still missing. If you need help with something join our discord
    `here <https://discord.gg/ubmkcsk>`_.

.. note::
   This documentation is for DeviantCord 2, which is more geared towards handling large amount of servers.
   If you are looking for DeviantCord 1, you can access its documentation
   `right here <https://deviantcord.readthedocs.io/en/bt-1.3.0/>`_.

Welcome to the official documentation for DeviantCord2, a Discord bot that allows the server to stay up to date with
their favorite artists.

Unlike DeviantCord 1, you do not need to wait for us to approve your request for the bot to join the server. You can
have the bot join the server using this `link <https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=576293421078282240&permissions=0&scope=bot>`_.

So jump right in!

Should I use the public bot?
=======================================

DeviantCord 2 is a major rewrite of the original DeviantCord discord bot, written specifically for multiserver use and
utilizes many server components to the bots advantage. If you are unfamiliar with Linux and Postgres, it is recommended
use the public bot that we offer for free.
