Getting the bot to join your server
************************************
Getting the bot to join your server is easy. All you need is:

- Manage Server Permission on the server in question.
- Administrator on the server to set the minimum rank for users of the bot.

Once you confirm you have the necessary permissions,  use the link
`link here <https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=576293421078282240&permissions=0&scope=bot>`_.
to make the bot join the server.

It should look similiar to the screenshot below

.. note:: If you do not have the requirements above on the server. The server will not show on this list.

Select the server you want to join the server to join.

Once the bot is in the server proceed to :doc:`permissions`
