************************************
Setting Up Listeners
************************************

There are two commands in DeviantCord that adds listeners that check gallery folders for new deviations.
Each command is associated with the type of folder. However this page aims to clear misconceptions with configuring listeners.

Things to Note:
*********************
* The bot needs Exact Foldernames (Case Sensitive)
* The bot needs the artists name exactly (Not Case Sensitive)
* Artist Username should be in quotes
* Folder name should be in quotes
* The addallfolder. Adds the artists All Folder. Meaning the listener will post notifications regarding any deviations
the artist posts.
* The addfolder command adds a listener that will post notifications of new deviations in that folder only.

An example of an inverted gallery can be seen `here <https://www.deviantart.com/pkm-150/gallery/58231950/Eeveelution-Squad>`_

Folder Properties
-----------------
.. warning::
    As of version bt-2.0.0, the inverse arguement no longer will automatically apply hybrid to true.

* Inverse: Listeners that should only check for new deviations at the top of the folder
* Hybrid: Listeners that should also check for the opposite of what inverse is set to

    ex: Inverse is set to true and hybrid is set to true. Meaning the bottom deviations will also be checked
* Mature: Whether Deviations flagged as mature in DeviantArt should be posted.

Correct Arguments
-----------------

For Example with the addfolder and addallfolder command it is :

~addfolder *<artist_username>* *<folder>* *<channel_id>* *<inverted>* *<hybrid>* *<mature>*

~addallfolder *<artist_username>* *<channelid>* *<mature>*

If we looked at an artists page, such as the one below

.. image:: SettingUp.PNG
*Example image from Zander-The-Artist (With Permission) see his work* `here <https://www.deviantart.com/zander-the-artist>`_

Looking above at the example image, and using it as an example you should note the following

The addartist command should have the artist name and in this case it would be "zander-the-artist" not "zander the artist"

The artist username field should be the same as the yellow highlighted area in the picture above.

The folder field for the Hope in Friends Comic folder should be the exactly what it is in the sidebar on the left.
In this case the folder for the comic Hope In Friends should be "Hope In Friends Comic" not "Hope in Friends"

$addartist "zander-the-artist" "Hope In Friends Comic" *<channel_id>* false false true

*Inverted in this case would be false, but it depends on what artist and what folder*
*Hybrid could be set to true or false in this case. If the artist has been known to accidently leave Deviations out of order*
*Mature can be set to your liking, again it depends on the what the folder typically contains*

Removing Folders
----------------
Removing a listener uses the same logic as the section above, if you haven't read the section it is suggested that you
read it first.

However there are some differences you should note. As there is only a remove folder listener command. This was
done to prevent accidentally deleting a whole artist from the folder as multiple folders can be stored under an artist.

As a result you can only delete one listener at a time.
The command is as follows ::
    ~deletefolder <artist_username> <folder> <channelid>

This will delete the folder from the artist.json file and no more notifications will be posted to Discord for that folder
unless you readd it.

Additionally if you are having trouble remembering what folders are currently being listened for new deviations you can
use the listfolders command ::
    ~listfolders


Discord Developer Mode
**********************
Discord Developer Mode is required in order to get text channel id's,
you will need to enable it by clicking the gear icon near your name

..  image:: discordprofile.png

Once you get into that menu click the Appearance Tab

..  image:: appearance.png

then scroll down to the bottom and enable Developer Mode.
