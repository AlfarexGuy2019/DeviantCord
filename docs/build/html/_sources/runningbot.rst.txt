***************
Running the Bot
***************

Once you have completed configuring the bot, you will need to run the bot

Open your respective commandline interface (ex: cmd, terminal, bash)

Navigate to the directory/folder the Bot resides in.

Check for your platform below

Linux
*****

If your Linux Distribution is not listed below
try the following commands ::
    python3 --version

Or
try ::
    python<version here> --version

Which ever one outputs a version that is at least 3.6 is what you will use instead replacing the version flag with Bot.py

This will start the bot.


Ubuntu/Linux Mint
------------------------

We only support Ubuntu versions 18.04 and above

For Linux Mint we only support 19+

The following command should
run the bot. ::
    python3 Bot.py


Debian 9
------------
..  warning::
    Debian 9 uses Python 3.5.3, the minimum supported version for the bot.
    It is not advised to use Python 3.5.3, as it may be deprecated within a future version.

If you want to use Python 3.5.3 then all you
need to do is ::
    python3 Bot.py

However, if you used
the guide for Python3.7 then use ::
    python3.7 Bot.py


CentOS 7
----------------------------------

Use the following
command ::
    python3.6 Bot.py


Fedora
----------------------------------

All you
need to do is ::
    python3 Bot.py




Windows
*******
Windows does it simple, all
you need to do is use the following command in cmd ::
    python Bot.py


MacOS (OSX)
***********

..  warning::
    DO NOT Use the python command instead use python3! The python command is linked to Python2
    which is installed on MacOS by default.

For MacOS all you
need to do is ::
    python3 Bot.py
