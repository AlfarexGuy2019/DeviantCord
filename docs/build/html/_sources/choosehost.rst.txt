Choosing a host
************************************
Choosing a host for the first time can be difficult, this page aims to answer your questions on what hosting company
you should choose for hosting your bot. As stated on the Installation page we recommend the following hosts.

We recommend the following hosts,

* `VPS Dime (Best Price to Specs) <https://vpsdime.com>`_
* `OVH (Better Security and DDoS Protection) <https://www.ovh.com/world/vps/>`_


Reasons for Using VPS Dime
**************************
VPS Dime offers more power then OVH does for its VPS SSD plans for half the price. While their VPS solutions work well
for a Discord bot, you are limited in terms of what else you can do with it, when compared with OVH there are no limits
or additional rules. If you plan on using the VPS for other reasons as well, make sure that they are in compliance with
VPS Dime's `TOS <https://vpsdime.com/#faq>`_

Lastly, if you are worried about DDoS Attacks DO NOT GO with VPS Dime, they do not offer DDoS Protection.
OVH offers reliable DDoS Protection with all of their plans.

Reasons for Using OVH
**************************
OVH offers a cheap price for its VPS products, while offering a balance of security and efficient power for its servers.
All of its VPS products and Dedicated servers include DDoS protection, which is great if you are planning on using the
VPS for only the bot and do not want limitations on what you can do with the VPS OVH is the best choice.
