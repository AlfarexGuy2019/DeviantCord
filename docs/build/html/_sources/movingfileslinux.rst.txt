Moving Files to Linux via SSH (Self Hosting)
*******************************************
One of the best ways to manage files on a remote Linux Server is via SSH.
All SSH Hosts have SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) enabled by default.

However you will need to use an SSH client that can interact with SFTP
We recommend WinSCP for Windows and Cyberduck for MacOS.

You can download them here

* `WinSCP (Windows) <https://winscp.net/eng/index.php>`_
* `Cyberduck (Mac) <https://cyberduck.io/>`_
