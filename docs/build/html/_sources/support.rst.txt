Contacting DeviantCord Support
******************************

Currently, support will be given only through the official DeviantCord Discord server.
Our support team at this time is very small and we plan on expanding it, but we keep support to Discord
to allow for others to help out and also allow for others who may be experiencing problems to see solutions staff may
have already answered.

You can join the server
`here <https://discord.gg/ubmkcsk>`_.
