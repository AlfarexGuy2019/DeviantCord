erriteCommands
==============

..  warning::
    This is only regarding the Public DeviantCord bot hosted by us not the self
    hosted bot.

Starting with bt-1.3.0 we added the ability to remove the public DeviantCord bot hosted by us from any Discord
server. This is the sole duty of the erriteCommands that can be seen when reloading DeviantCord on the public bot.
It cannot run any other command not related to forcefully removing a bot from a server.
The reason we implemented this was incase a situation arose where we needed to forcefully remove our bot from a server.
Primarily in the instance that the bot is being abused or violating Discordâ€™s ToS/Community Guidelines.
We will also use this if staff members of a particular server repeatedly come on the DeviantCord Discord server and
break the rules in regards to support. In this case we will always reach out to staff members/owner on the server and
give them plenty of options and warning that if the behavior continues that they will lose access to the DeviantCord
public bot. This only used a last resort and only Michael (Lead Developer of DeviantCord) can forcefully make
the the bot leave a server.
