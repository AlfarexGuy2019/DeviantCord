Requesting Hosting for DeviantCord
************************************
Errite/the group that develops the bot allows for communities to request hosting for the bot through us.
Though we do have a few requirements

- Join the DeviantCord Discord server
- Fill out the Google Forms for requesting hosting `Request Bot <https://forms.gle/6PiGroDvr7UdDH7h9>`_

These requirements are mandatory to make sure that staff members can contact server owners by having a mutual server
additionally it will allow for server owners/staff to be able to see announcements regarding the bot such as maintenance,
and issues.

Support
========================
Support will be given only through the official DeviantCord Discord server.
Our support team at this time is very small and we plan on expanding it, but we keep support to Discord
to allow for others to help out and also allow for others who may be experiencing problems to see solutions staff may
have already answered.


I've requested it! Now what?
============================
Requests will usually be done in no more then 3 days, to which a staff member will DM you with an invite link for
the bot. However since the staff team consists of volunteers there may be times where there are delays. These delays
will usually be talked about in the delays discord text channel. If there is no response to you and nothing in the delays
text channel contact a staff member.



FAQ
============================

**Is there any difference between the self-hosting and the hosting you provide?**

No, there is no major difference at this time in terms of functionality. The files provided on Github are the same ones
used on the hosting we provide. The only difference is that we handle the management of the bot from the hosting side of
things such as handling maintenance, and upgrading the bot.
